Problem Analysis:

The problem asks us to find the intersection of two integer arrays. The intersection should include duplicate elements, and the result can be in any order.
The solution uses a two-pointer approach with sorted arrays. Here's a detailed explanation of the problem-solving approach:

Sort both input arrays.
Initialize two pointers, one for each sorted array.
Compare elements at the current pointers:

If elements are equal, add to the result and move both pointers.
If the element in the first array is smaller, move its pointer.
If the element in the second array is smaller, move its pointer.


Continue until one of the arrays is fully traversed.

This approach efficiently finds the intersection by leveraging the sorted order of the arrays.
Suggestions for improving the solution:

Consider using a hash map approach for unsorted arrays, which could be more efficient for certain inputs.
Implement early termination if one array is fully traversed.
Optimize space usage by modifying the shorter array in-place instead of creating a new output array.
Add input validation to handle edge cases (e.g., empty arrays).


Time Complexity:

Sorting both arrays: O(n log n + m log m), where n and m are the lengths of nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Traversing the sorted arrays: O(min(n, m))
Overall time complexity: O(n log n + m log m)

The dominant factor is the sorting step, which overshadows the linear-time traversal.
Space Complexity:

O(n + m) for sorting (depending on the sorting algorithm used)
O(min(n, m)) for the output array in the worst case
Overall space complexity: O(n + m)
